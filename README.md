# urban-pluvial-flooding-analysis
EDA and insights for urban pluvial flooding risks using synthetic city-level dataset (PS2 project)
🌊 Urban Pluvial Flooding Risk Analysis
📌 Problem Statement
Local shops and street vendors struggle with pluvial flooding (urban waterlogging after heavy rain), which damages goods, reduces customer flow, and causes financial losses.

🎯 Objective
To build a data-driven solution that analyzes urban flood risk factors and helps local businesses and authorities prepare better for flood-prone conditions.

💡 Proposed Solution
Collect and analyze urban flooding datasets (rainfall, drainage, land use, elevation, etc.).
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify flood-prone zones.
Build visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, bar graphs) to highlight vulnerable areas.
Provide recommendations for mitigation strategies for local shops.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy → Data cleaning & analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly → Visualization
Jupyter Notebook → Interactive exploration

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/urban-pluvial-flooding-analysis.git
cd urban-pluvial-flooding-analysis


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb

📊 Results / Visualizations
Rainfall vs Flood Risk heatmap
Flood-prone zone scatter plot
Shop vulnerability analysis
Correlation between land use & flooding

🔮 Future Scope
Build a machine learning model to predict flooding risk.
Create a real-time flood monitoring dashboard.
Provide early warning alerts to local shopkeepers.
